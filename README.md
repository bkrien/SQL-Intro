# Introduction to Structured Query Language (SQL)
In this lab, you will explore using the Structured Query Language (SQL, pronounced "sequel") to add, organize, and search through data. 

## What You'll Do
1. Create and connect tables in using SQL
2. Set the data types for the values in your tables
3. Add data to populate the tables 
4. Create queries to return records meeting specific criteria

## Why It Matters
SQL is one of the most common and most powerful ways to create, manage, and query data in a relational database. While most librarians don't need to master SQL in order to do their work, understanding how SQL works and, by extension, how relational databases are created, managed, and used is useful knowledge for those working in libraries or in any field that involves the organization of information.

We'll just be scratching the surface of what you can do with SQL in this lab. Anyone interested in learning more about SQL and relational databases should consider taking [SLIS 6100: Database Management](https://catalog.registrar.uiowa.edu/graduate-college/library-information-science/#:~:text=SLIS%3A6100%20Database%20Management)

## Instructions
### DB Fiddle
For this lab, we'll be using a free, online database tool called [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/). This tool will allow you to create and explore a small database using SQL, without the need to download any software or access a special server setup.
